* basile.nvim - Neovim config
  My personal Neovim config, written in Lua. Tailored specifically to my needs, but feel free to use it as a base for your own config.

** Features
*** AI with `avante.nvim`
    {https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim}[`avante.nvim`] is a Neovim plugin made to provide a more intelligent completion experience. It is heavily inspired by the Cursor IDE and offers similar features.

*** Neorg
{https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg}[Neorg] is a note-taking plugin for Neovim. It allows you to create and manage notes in a simple and organized way. I also use it for literate programming, which I did for my {https://github.com/davidbasilefilho/basile.tmux}[`tmux` config], for example.

*** LSP, Treesitter, and more
    It includes a lot of features like LSP, Treesitter, diagnostics, debugging, and more.

** Dependencies
   - Neovim 0.10.0 or higher is recommended.
   - `git`, `make`, `unzip`, `gcc`.
   - `ripgrep`.
   - A clipboard tool (`xclip`, `xsel`, `win32yank` or other depending on the platform).
   - A {https://www.nerdfonts.com/}[Nerd Font] for the icons, I use Geist Mono.
   - `luarocks` for Neorg.
   - `tmux` for the integration with it.

** Installation
   @code bash
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
   git clone https://github.com/davidbasilefilho/basile.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim
   @end
